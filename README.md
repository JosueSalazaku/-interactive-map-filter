# Interactive map filther

Interactive map filters are a feature that allows users to customize the information displayed on a map. By applying filters, users can focus on specific data layers or categories, making the map more useful and relevant to their needs. For example, on a real estate website, filters could be used to display properties within a certain price range or of a certain type. Similarly, on a travel website, filters could be used to show only hotels, tourist attractions, or restaurants. This feature enhances user interaction and engagement, providing a more personalized user experience.
